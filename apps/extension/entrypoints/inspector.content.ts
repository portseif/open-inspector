 * access. The background worker injects this file via `scripting.executeScript`
 * under `activeTab`, which the user grants per-tab by clicking the toolbar
 * button and which the browser revokes on navigation.

 * whenever the background worker is stale (an unpacked extension whose files
 * changed on disk but which was never reloaded), and it is indistinguishable
 * from a working extension until it is given a deadline.
