/**
 * Open a browser with the extension already installed, for hands-on use.
 *
 * Why this exists: branded Chrome removed support for the `--load-extension`
 * command-line switch. Verified dead in Chrome 150 — the profile registers
 * zero extensions and the browser logs "--load-extension is not allowed in
 * Google Chrome, ignoring."
 *
 * Do not try to revive it with
 * `--disable-features=DisableLoadExtensionCommandLineSwitch`. That flag is now
 * a silent no-op: the switch became a compile-time branding check, and the
 * feature symbol the flag names no longer exists. Carrying it makes a broken
 * launch config look deliberate.
 *
 * Side-loading into your everyday Chrome now requires clicking through
 * chrome://extensions by hand, which is fine but tedious to repeat.
 *
 * Playwright's Chromium is not subject to that restriction, so this gives you
 * a disposable browser with the extension loaded in one command. The profile
 * lives in .output/ and is thrown away with the rest of the build artifacts —
 * your real browser profile is never touched.
 *
 * Usage:  pnpm launch  [url]
