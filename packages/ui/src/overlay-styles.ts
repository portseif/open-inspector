/**
 * Styles for the overlay's shadow tree.
 *
 * Colours follow the browser box-model convention — orange margin, yellow
 * border, green padding, blue content — because that mapping is already in
 * every web developer's muscle memory. Inventing a new one would be a
 * gratuitous thing to make people learn.
 *
 * There are no transitions anywhere in here. An overlay that eases into
 * position smears behind the cursor and reads as lag; instantaneous is both
 * correct and, incidentally, free of any reduced-motion concern.
